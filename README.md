# TriviaGame

#In this game, the user begins the game by clicking the "Click to Play!" button.

#Each question is presented with four answers, and a 20 second timer.

#If the user selects the right answer, a message stating the answer was correct and a celebratory gif are displayed for 5 seconds, and the next question is displayed without user action.

#If the user selects the wrong answer, a message stating the answer was wrong, the correct answer and a related gif are displayed for 5 seconds, and the next question is displayed without user action.

#If the timer runs out, a "Time's Up!" message is displayed, as well as the correct answer and a related gif for 5 seconds, and the next question is displayed without user action.

#Once all 10 questions are answered, the amount of questions the user got correct as well as the amount the user got wrong are displayed, as well as a "Play Again?" button.

#Once the "Play Again?" button is selected, the game is restarted without reloading the page.
